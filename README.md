# Hendecagons

Hendecagons is a simple touch-based game for iOS.  I developed it based on Reaction from my SimpleApps2 folder.  

A hendecagon is an eleven-sided polygon, which replaces the circles found in the original game.  This expands on the original and features multiple levels and increasingly-difficult rounds.
