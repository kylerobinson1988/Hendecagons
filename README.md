# Hendecagons

Hendecagons is a simple touch-based game for iOS.  I developed it based on Reaction from my SimpleApps2 folder.  

A hendecagon is an eleven-sided polygon, which replaces the circles found in the original game.  This expands on the original and features multiple levels and increasingly-difficult rounds, as well as changing backgrounds and piece positions. The background colors, shapes, piece positions, and other information is stored in Parse, so I can modify it remotely to create new levels for the game.

The goal of Hendecagons is to select the eleven-sided Hendecagon from the shapes that appear onscreen. This starts out easy, but as the levels go up, the number of pieces increases, and the number of sides in the wrong pieces increases, the game gets much more challenging.
